    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Journey Specification Agent</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">The Journey Specification Agent takes design artefacts and converts them into screen
      templates.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Designs often have gaps, or assume the developer already understands certain decisions. The
      Coding Agent should only write code, not fill gaps or make product decisions. So the Journey Specification Agent
      fills those gaps first and returns the journey in a format that is easy to review. You review the output before
      passing to the next agent, so the solution is complete before implementation begins.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Customise this for your project. Tell the agent where your designs come from.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Screen descriptions</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Copy and paste plain text descriptions of the screens and user journey.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Figma MCP</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">You can import designs directly from Figma. Connect to the Figma MCP, then paste the URL of
      the page containing your journey.
    </p>

    {{ govukWarningText({
    text: "Use of MCP servers requires explicit permission for your project. To request access, ask in #ask-ace.",
    iconFallbackText: "Warning"
    }) }}

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Other designs</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">You can use any format for your designs, including images, screenshots and user stories.
      Include all the files the agent needs. If something does not work, ask in #ask-ace for support.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Analyse</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Use a powerful AI agent to create the specification file. Complex tasks work best with more
      powerful models. Copy the <a href="#" class="govuk-link prompt-modal-link"
                                   data-prompt="/prompts/journey-specification-agent.md">Journey Specification Agent
        prompt</a> and add your designs.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Review</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Review the output carefully. Start with the Decision Log to see the most critical decisions.
      Then go screen by screen, checking the order is correct. Finally, review the details for each screen.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Friction is data. If you spot mistakes at this stage, the final result will be better. If you
      can update the agent prompt, the fix benefits everyone who uses this workflow after you.</p>
